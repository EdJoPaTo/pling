## Contributions welcome!

This crate is fairly new, and I only have a limited view where this is useful.
There might be other use cases I haven't seen so far.
Hints like "This crate would need X for â€¦" are welcome!
Implementations for other Platforms are a great way to contribute too.

Documentation always needs some improvements.
After all you are the one trying to get it working and know best what's missing in the docs.
